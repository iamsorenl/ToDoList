# To Do List

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using Vue.js and Flask, demonstrating the integration of a frontend JavaScript framework (Vue.js) with a backend Python framework (Flask). Users can add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks, with all data being stored on the server. The project includes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to handle requests from different origins.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Flask (Python): A micro web framework for backend development.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- CORS: A middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Flask.
- HTML and CSS: For building the user interface.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: You will need Python 3.x to run the Flask backend. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Node.js**: The Vue.js frontend is built with Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: This is included with Node.js, so you should have npm installed after installing Node.js.
